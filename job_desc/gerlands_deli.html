        This job paid roughly six dollars an hour, and was pretty slow. Unfortunately, the shifts were six hours long, and I usually worked the closing shift. The uniform was a white dress shirt and black slacks, which was weird. Since this job, I have not worn a white dress shirt with black slacks to work.

        I cut deli meats and cheese using a deli slicer. I never hurt myself, and I never really understood the different measurements people wanted. My cold cuts were either real thin, regularish size, or very thick. If someone said a 0 or a 3, I would nod and cut off a guess.

        "How does this look?"
        <br><br>
        Most of the time, it was fine.

        A real highlight of this job was coming in and starting the dinner batch of rotisserie chickens. I would go to the butcher section, grab a box of whole fryer chickens from the freezer and take them back to the deli. Then I would rip out the fat from the inside of the chicken and throw it away. What followed is what could be called "liberal seasoning". Then I would skewer the chickens on the rotisserie rack and put them in the rotating oven. I enjoyed that I had to do this every time I came into work, it was a nice routine to start the shift. The act of gutting these chickens and covering them in lemon pepper.

        The Deli was mainly staffed by people of color, young and old. Most of the time, I worked with an older Hispanic lady who thought my name was Isaac the entire time I was there. The other employees were younger, it was the Deli that had older folks.
