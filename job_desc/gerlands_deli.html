    <h3>Gerland's Grand Market (RIP)
        <span class="job__title">Deli Worker</span>
    </h3>
    <h4>Sugar Land, Texas

        This job paid like six bucks an hour, and was pretty slow most of the time. 
        Unfortunately the shifts were six hours long, and I always worked the closing shift.
        Also, I had to wear a white dress shirt and black slacks all the time, which was weird.
        Currently, as a 30 year old, I have never worn a white dress shirt with black slacks to work since this job.

        I cut deli meats and cheese using a deli slicer. I never hurt myself, and I never really understood the different measurements people wanted. 
        My cold cuts were either real thin, regularish size, or hella thick. If you said something like 0 or 3 or whatever, I would nod and cut off a guess.
        <br><br>
        "How does this look?"
        <br><br>
        Most of the time, it was fine.
        <br><br>
        A real highlight of this job was coming in and starting the dinner batch of rotisserie chickens. 
        I would go to the butcher section, grab a box of whole fryers from the freezer and take them back to the deli. Then I would rip out the fat from the inside of the chicken and throw it away.
        <br>
        What followed is what could be called "liberal seasoning". 
        Then I would skewer the chickens on the rotisserie rack and put them in the rotating oven. 
        I enjoyed that I had to do this every time I came into work, it was a nice routine to start the shift, gutting these chickens and covering them in lemon pepper.

        The Deli was staffed by older minorities, and two younger minorities (of which I was one).
        A lot of the time, I worked with an older Hispanic lady who thought my name was Isaac the entire time I was there.
        The other people working at the store were younger, it's just the Deli that was filled with older folks.
