        At Ben and Jerry's, I learned how to scoop ice cream properly. 
        It requires a lot of forearm strength, as well as tilting the spoon on it's side.
        This is also where I learned to sweep and mop.

        We also had to cater youth football games, which involved getting to work at 5 AM, loading a U-Haul with grilling and cooking gear, as well as coolers for ice cream. 
        This was before YETI was invented, so the ice cream was done for.
        I believe we were ready by 8 or 9 AM to serve kids and parents, and we started to pack around 3 PM.
        Then you load back up and head to the shop to unload, finishing at 5PM.

        One time I catered, and then went to my Senior Homecoming. 
        Between the events, I went to a nearby Starbucks to get a double shot of espresso. 
        I'm bad with hot drinks, so I got it iced.
        It was terrible, and started my appreciation of coffee.
