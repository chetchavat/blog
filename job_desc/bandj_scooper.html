        I scooped ice cream.
        <br><br>
        I learned how to clean. I learned how to make everything: milkshakes, smoothies, waffle cones, sundaes.
        I learned that sometimes, adults don't listen to you because they don't want to. I later learned it was because I was serving them.
        <br><br>
        I learned that Baklava ice cream was gross, strawberry sorbet and peanut butter ice cream make a PB&J, and that friends will exploit you for free ice cream.
        <br><br>
        I was paid minimally, and I embraced tips.
        <br><br>
        Cherry Garcia is still pretty good.
